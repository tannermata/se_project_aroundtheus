**Intro**
  
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. They will easily flow between screen sizes with out being cut off form your view. It also show cases some new features like importing fonts and buttons for editing your profile or creating and liking posts in your gallery. This was dont using the knowledge of flex-box, grids and knowing how to make elements more flexible with max-widths instead of standard width and heights. 

This standard of creating a beautiful layout is all to the BEM standards and adding elements in the correct order.
